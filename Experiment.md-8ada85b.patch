+Checklist when modifying an existing page:
+
+- [ ] What is the goal of changing the page?
+- [ ] What metrics are we trying to affect?
+- [ ] How will we decide if the change was successful or not?
+- [ ] Would we revert the changes if we decided that it was not a success?
+- [ ] Make sure events are reflected in Google Analytics/Marketo if the page is changed
+- [ ] Make sure redirection is done if we change the page so email newsletters do not contain dead link
